    <img src="TW.jpg" alt="Twice Baked Potato Casserole With Bacon">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Why bother with individual twice baked potatoes when you can make this handy casserole instead?</p> 
    <p> Each serving is loaded up with buttery chive potatoes, Cheddar, and bacon bits.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large baking potatoes</li>
        <li>½ pound lean bacon</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded mild Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried chives</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish</li>
        <li>Use a toothpick to poke a few holes into each potato.</li>
        <li>Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until fully cooked, about 1 hour. Cool for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut a thin slice from one side of each baked potato; carefully scoop out flesh and transfer to a large bowl. Discard skins.</li>
        <li>Mix 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, sour cream, milk, butter, chives, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper into potatoes until well combined.</li>
        <li>Spread potato mixture into the prepared casserole dish; top with remaining Cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until just bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool for at least 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
