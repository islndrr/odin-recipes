    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Get a quadruple dose of cheesy goodness with a Parmesan-Romano blend as well as Colby-Jack. Chicken and bacon make this pasta carbonara a rich and filling meal.</p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package thick-cut bacon</li>          
        <li> ⅓ cup olive oil </li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>  
        <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic</li>          
        <li>3 teaspoons ground black pepper, divided</li>        
        <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, sliced</li>           
        <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>            
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan-Romano cheese blend</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Colby Jack cheese blend</li>        
        <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Chop into small pieces when cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and olive oil; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>While pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large, deep skillet over low heat. Add chopped bacon, garlic, and 1 teaspoon pepper; sauté until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium, add chicken, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add whipping cream, Parmesan-Romano cheese, and remaining 2 teaspoons pepper to the skillet. Stir and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Add Colby-Jack cheese and stir until melted. Stir in beaten eggs and bring to a simmer. Add drained pasta and stir until coated with sauce.</li>
